## 608: Tree Node

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

- "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node. <br>
- "Root": if the node is the root of the tree. <br>
- "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node. <br>

Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in any order.
